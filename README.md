### Description
This repository features the following data structure implementations:  

* A singly-linked list
* A stack
* A queue 

The stack and queue are backed by the singly-linked list and therefore share the same internal characteristics. The basic operations of insertion and deletion are supported, in addition to several other convenience methods. Finally, take note that the data structures currently only support the integer data type. However, I plan to update the implementations so that other data types are supported as well.
